# Phantom
An Advanced tool for bypassing AV/EDR.
This project showcases a memory injection tool designed to deploy XOR-encrypted shellcode into remote processes.
The tool also incorporates multiple anti-analysis techniques, including virtual machine detection, debugger detection, and static analysis tools detection.
This tool can be used for advanced cybersecurity testing, allowing users to execute shellcode covertly in a controlled environment.




# Features

**[+] Obfuscation Techniques:** Employs XOR encryption to avoid signature-based detection.

**[+] Memory Injection:** Allocates and manipulates memory for shellcode injection.

**[+] Anti-Debugging/Anti-Sandboxing:** Validates environnement first to detect if its in a sandbox or if debuggers/analysis Tools are present.
